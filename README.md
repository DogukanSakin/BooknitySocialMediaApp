# BooknityApp (*still in development*)
This app is a simple social media app developed using the Firebase database where book readers can meet and match with other readers. 

## Features
- With Firebase integration, you can register and log in to the application. The application evaluates all situations that may occur in this process. (Registration with the same mail, password mismatch, etc.) 
- You can share posts in the app as you wish and see the posts of other users. 
- You can add photos to your posts as you like. You can like all posts. 
- You can search for books that are already registered, and if you can't find them, you can add a new book. 
- You can change the book you are reading as you wish. Other users will be able to see this on your profile. Similarly, you can see theirs. 
- You can add and remove any book from your favorite books. Your favorite books are displayed on your profile by other users. 
- You can chat with any user.  
- The app allows you to match with any user who is reading the same book as you. In this way, you can get to know new people with the book you read.
